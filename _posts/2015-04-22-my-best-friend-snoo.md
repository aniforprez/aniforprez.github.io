The TV show app is officially on hold. :/

I'll admit that was way too fast but I have reasons! Really...
Truth is TVDB.org, from whom I wanted to fetch the database, are changing their API and it looks to be more streamlined than the PHP fuckstorm that it currently is. They'll have better standards for their images and more simple API calls for data that should have been more easy to fetch in the first place. This new API will have the benefit of community input and more planned development. So I'll wait and in the meantime...

I'm starting a new project as a API consumer of Reddit where you can search through your personal links like saved, hidden, liked and disliked. This feature is sorely mising from the default website and it sucks balls.

As mentioned in the previous post, I will use the MeanJS standard template as a starting point for the project. I will use the folder & component structure used to make the app production-ready and robust. Because I want to learn how to make industry-standard applications. This gonne be gud...
