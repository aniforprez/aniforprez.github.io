**Thus it begins**

As I write this post, at 2:35 in the early hours before the cock crows, after having spent around 4 hours trying my darndest to get this blog started, ignoring all cries from my body demanding I rest my eyes and mind and drift to the lands crafted by Morpheus, after struggling through the labyrinthine mess that is the documentation for jekyll, after the Herculean tasks of installing git, the disappointment in finding that I never really needed it anyway, after all these trials and tribulations, I find myself asking the important question...

**What the FUCK am I doing?**

In any case, thus begins the fantastical journey that is the documentation of my life. And the logging of the development of my pet project _"Book My Binge"_, a site that would log all your TV show habits. I plan to host it on Github soon.

The current development status is that the site is now a bunch of config files that will soon hopefully be the backbone of a decent project. I'm going to rip the syntax and structure of Mean.js but without a lot of the needless modularisation frenzy that it has. I'd like my index.html in public/ thank you very much.

I'm done for the day. I just want to sleep now...
